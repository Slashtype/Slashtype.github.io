                                        has subscribed. .</p>
                                    <p>The acquisition of a subscription plan being a prerequisite to the acquisition of any

                                    <p>Upon termination of the Agreement, such termination shall relieve WAKANDA SAS from
                                        any of its obligations related to the Agreement. LICENSEE of the Development version shall stop using it.
